About Soulcial
Soulcial is a self-generated social metaverse driven by on-chain behavior and real-world data. Based on personality traits and accumulating SoulScore, users can co-create with AI and generate SoulCast NFT as personalized social assets. These SoulCasts can be collected, showcased and combined to build user's own soul-centric metaverse. It helps everyone connect with more soulmates and earn additional tokens.
Innovation:
Web3 based Social Metrics: Our project establishes a social scoring model, called SoulScore, driven by historical transaction activities and real-world data. SoulScore is a dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of on-chain and off-chain activities.  It can help huge numbers of users in Web2 begin their Web3 journey.
Composable Metaverse: With accumulating SoulScore, users can co-create with AI and generate their own exclusive social assets, called SoulCast, which is a composable NFT with personality traits and SoulScore. All SoulCast can be assembled into a space to form the userâ€™s own social metaverse.
Connect2Earn: We provide liquidity incentive pools to guide users to make connections through collecting more social assets. Users who place more bids for SoulCast will be rewarded with more tokens.
